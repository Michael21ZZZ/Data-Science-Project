# Data Science Projects

Hi! Welcome to Michael's github repository. My name is Ruoyu (Michael) Zhang and I am a graduate student at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University. I am currently seeking for 2022 summer internship for data scientist and data analyst. Here's my linkedin page: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruoyumichael/. Feel free to contact me!

## Projects
### [Stroke Prediction With Logistic Regression](http://rpubs.com/Michael_Zhang/851701) (R|Data Visulization|Machine Learning)
A stroke is a medical condition in which poor blood flow to the brain causes cell death.According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. As a healthcare analytics student, what interests me is whether we could predict the stroke outcome for potential patients. This project aims to predict whether people will have stroke based on historical data. 

This is a individual final project for Programming R for Analytics. In this project, I mainly accomplish:
- Cleaning and visualizing the Stroke Dataset with dplyr and ggplot2
- Apply Logistic Regression to predict the stroke outcome and discover the relationship between prediction accuracy and cutoff level.

### [MusicMiner](https://github.com/Michael21ZZZ/Data-Science-Project/blob/main/Music_Miner_Michael.ipynb) (Python|)
The music industry has a well-developed market with global annual revenue of around $15 billion. The recording industry is highly competitive and is dominated by three big production companies which make up nearly 82\% of the total annual album sales. In this project, we are trying to explore whether there are any country-specific music preferences for popular songs in Spotify.

This is a group final project for Data Mining. The presentation video is [here](https://youtu.be/iMWCLRqX8Bc).In this project, my contribution includes:

### [EasyApply College Application]()()
College Admission could be time-consuming and troublesome due to overwhelming information. Besides, it also takes time to compare different colleges since there are multiple dimensions. Easy Apply is a product that helps college applicants find the universities they desire and compare colleges based on multiple dimensions. 

This is a group final project for Data Focused Python. The presentation video is [here](https://youtu.be/iMWCLRqX8Bc).In this project, my contribution includes:
- Wes
    This file is the main file of the product. It loads the data from 4
    difference sources and asks users to choose from 2 functions. The first
    function is to search for some universities' information by entering
    some filters, like rank, living cost or cities and shows the detailed
    information about the universities. The second function is to compare
    directly 2 universities by entering the universities' name and shows
    the compared table and a graph.
