## Projects
### [Stroke Prediction With Logistic Regression](http://rpubs.com/Michael_Zhang/851701) (R|Data Visulization|Machine Learning)
A stroke is a medical condition in which poor blood flow to the brain causes cell death.According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. As a healthcare analytics student, what interests me is whether we could predict the stroke outcome for potential patients. This project aims to predict whether people will have stroke based on historical data. 

This is a individual final project for Programming R for Analytics. In this project, I mainly accomplish:
- Cleaned and visualized the Stroke Dataset with dplyr and ggplot2
- Applied Logistic Regression to predict the stroke outcome and discover the relationship between prediction accuracy and cutoff level.

### [MusicMiner](https://github.com/Michael21ZZZ/Data-Science-Project/blob/main/Music_Miner_Michael.ipynb) (Python|EDA|Machine Learning)
The music industry has a well-developed market with global annual revenue of around $15 billion. The recording industry is highly competitive and is dominated by three big production companies which make up nearly 82\% of the total annual album sales. In this project, we are trying to explore whether there are any country-specific music preferences for popular songs in Spotify.

This is a group final project for Data Mining. The presentation video is [here](https://youtu.be/iMWCLRqX8Bc).In this project, my contribution includes:
- Applied Naive Bayes to conduct contry-wise classification and use k-means for clustering
- Used Principal Component Analysis and Feature Selectionn to discover specific features for different types of countries

### [EasyApply College Application](https://github.com/Michael21ZZZ/Data-Science-Project/tree/main/EasyApply) (Python|Data Visulization|Web Scrape)
College Admission could be time-consuming and troublesome due to overwhelming information. Besides, it also takes time to compare different colleges since there are multiple dimensions. Easy Apply is a product that helps college applicants find the universities they desire and compare colleges based on multiple dimensions. 

This is a group final project for Data Focused Python. The presentation video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFSpSDBvYP4).In this project, my contribution includes:
- Scraped web data about cost of living in US cities with BeautifulSoup and conducted data merging and data cleaning
- Implemented the filter function based on rank, living cost and location

### [Graduate School Admission](https://rpubs.com/Michael_Zhang/856263) (R|Data Visualization|Machine Learning)
In the process of applying to graduate school, various indicators of the applicant will have an impact on the probability of admission, and will also determine the relative position of the applicant among the candidates. Based on graduate admission data from Kaggle, this project analyzes the importance ranking of admission indicators, and divides the degree of excellence of applicants. 

This is a individual final project for Multivariable Statistics Analysis. In this project, I mainly accomplish:
-	Employed Principal Component Analysis and Factor Analysis to unearth critical parameters for graduate school admission and their correlation in R based on a Kaggle dataset
-	Applied Hierarchical Clustering to group applicants with a similar background and separated applicants with high chances of admission using Linear Discriminant Analysis
