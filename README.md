# Data Science Projects
Hi! Welcome to Michael's github repository. My name is Ruoyu (Michael) Zhang and I am a graduate student at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University. I am currently seeking for 2022 summer internship for data scientist and data analyst.

## Projects
### R
#### [Stroke Prediction With Logistic Regression](http://rpubs.com/Michael_Zhang/851701)
This project aims to predict whether people will have stroke based on historical data. We mainly want to finsh two tasks:
- Find out what input features might affect the stroke outcome
- Predict the stroke outcome

### Python
#### [Spotify Music Recommendation](https://github.com/Michael21ZZZ/Data-Science-Project/blob/main/Music_Miner_Michael.ipynb)
The music industry has a well-developed market with global annual revenue of around $15 billion. The recording industry is highly competitive and is dominated by three big production companies which make up nearly 82\% of the total annual album sales. In this project, we are trying to explore whether there are any country-specific music preferences for popular songs in Spotify.

This is my part of Data Mining Final Project. You may find the presentation to the project [here](https://youtu.be/iMWCLRqX8Bc).
