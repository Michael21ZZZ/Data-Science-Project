## Projects
### [Stroke Prediction With Logistic Regression](http://rpubs.com/Michael_Zhang/851701) (R|Data Visulization|Machine Learning)
This project aims to predict whether people will have stroke based on historical data. We mainly want to finsh two tasks:
- Find out what input features might affect the stroke outcome
- Predict the stroke outcome

This is a individual final project for Programming R for Analytics.

### [MusicMiner](https://github.com/Michael21ZZZ/Data-Science-Project/blob/main/Music_Miner_Michael.ipynb) (Python|)
The music industry has a well-developed market with global annual revenue of around $15 billion. The recording industry is highly competitive and is dominated by three big production companies which make up nearly 82\% of the total annual album sales. In this project, we are trying to explore whether there are any country-specific music preferences for popular songs in Spotify.

This is a group final project for Data Mining. The presentation video is [here](https://youtu.be/iMWCLRqX8Bc).

### [EasyApply College Application]
This is a group final project for Data Focused Python. The presentation video is [here](https://youtu.be/HFSpSDBvYP4).
