#### [Stroke Prediction With Logistic Regression](http://rpubs.com/Michael_Zhang/851701)
This project aims to predict whether people will have stroke based on historical data. We mainly want to finsh two tasks:

### Python
#### [Spotify Music Recommendation]()
The music industry has a well-developed market with global annual revenue of around $15 billion. The recording industry is highly competitive and is dominated by three big production companies which make up nearly 82\% of the total annual album sales. In this project, we are trying to explore whether there are any country-specific music preferences for popular songs in Spotify.
